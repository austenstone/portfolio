# Game of Life

An interactive implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, the famous cellular automaton that demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.

## Overview

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## The Rules

Conway's Game of Life follows four simple rules:

1. **Underpopulation** - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
2. **Survival** - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
3. **Overpopulation** - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
4. **Reproduction** - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell

Despite these simple rules, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex and beautiful patterns.

### Historical Context

The Game of Life was created by John Conway in 1970 and popularized in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column in Scientific American. It has since become one of the most famous examples of cellular automata and has inspired countless variations and research.

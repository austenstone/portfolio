## Project Overview

deviceWISE View is an industrial data visualization platform that I designed and developed as both a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) builder. The platform was created to help manufacturing companies digitize their operations by providing real-time monitoring and control capabilities through customizable dashboards.

## My Role as Creator

As the **sole creator and architect** of deviceWISE View during my tenure at Telit (2018-2021), I was responsible for the entire product lifecycle from concept to enterprise deployment. I have since transitioned the project to a dedicated team for ongoing development and support.

### Creation & Development
- **Product Vision** - Conceived the no-code approach to industrial dashboard creation
- **Technical Architecture** - Designed the drag-and-drop interface and widget system
- **Full-Stack Development** - Built the complete platform from frontend UI to backend data processing
- **Industrial Integration** - Implemented native support for industrial protocols and machine connectivity
- **User Experience Design** - Created intuitive interfaces specifically for industrial environments

### Enterprise Impact & Success
- **Market Validation** - Successfully deployed across multiple industrial customers
- **Revenue Generation** - Platform contributed significantly to Telit's IoT platform revenue
- **Customer Adoption** - Proven demand in manufacturing, energy, and process industries
- **Team Transition** - Successfully handed off the project to a dedicated development team for continued growth

### Innovation & Problem-Solving
- **No-Code Pioneer** - Addressed the gap between technical complexity and domain expertise in industrial settings
- **User-Centric Design** - Created interfaces that industrial engineers could use without programming knowledge
- **Performance Optimization** - Engineered real-time data processing for industrial-grade performance requirements
- **Scalable Architecture** - Designed the platform to handle enterprise-scale deployments

## Business Impact

### Market Success
Creating deviceWISE View from concept to commercial product demonstrated my ability to:
- **Identify Market Opportunities** - Recognized the need for accessible industrial IoT tools
- **Execute Product Vision** - Delivered a complete platform that solved real customer problems
- **Drive Commercial Value** - Built a product that generated substantial revenue for Telit
- **Enable Customer Success** - Empowered industrial companies to accelerate their digital transformation

### Competitive Advantage
The platform's unique no-code approach provided significant advantages:
- **Faster Implementation** - Reduced dashboard development time from weeks to hours
- **Lower Barriers to Entry** - Enabled domain experts to create solutions without programming
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Allowed customers to quickly validate concepts and iterate
- **Cost Effectiveness** - Eliminated the need for custom development resources

## Technical Capabilities

### Core Features I Built
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface** - Intuitive widget-based dashboard creation without coding
- **Industrial Protocol Support** - Native drivers for common industrial communication protocols
- **Real-Time Data Visualization** - Live streaming of machine and sensor data
- **Mobile-Responsive Design** - Dashboards accessible on tablets and mobile devices
- **Bidirectional Control** - Both monitoring and machine control capabilities

### Industrial Applications
- **Manufacturing Dashboards** - Production line monitoring and KPI visualization
- **Preventive Maintenance** - Equipment health monitoring and alert systems
- **Energy Management** - Power consumption tracking and optimization
- **Quality Control** - Real-time process monitoring and compliance tracking

## Platform Architecture

### Technology Stack I Designed
- **Frontend** - Web-based responsive interface built for industrial environments
- **Backend** - Integration with deviceWISE IoT platform with edge computing capabilities
- **Communication** - Support for industrial protocols (Modbus, OPC, MQTT, etc.)
- **Deployment** - On-premises, cloud, or hybrid deployment options

### Integration Capabilities
- **Machine Connectivity** - Direct connection to PLCs, sensors, and industrial equipment

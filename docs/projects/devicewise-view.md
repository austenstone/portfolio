# deviceWISE View

A **no-code Industrial IoT dashboard and HMI builder** that I created from the ground up during my time at Telit. This platform enables industrial engineers to create SCADA visualizations and machine interfaces without writing custom code.

## Project Overview

deviceWISE View is an industrial data visualization platform that I designed and developed as both a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) builder. The platform was created to help manufacturing companies digitize their operations by providing real-time monitoring and control capabilities through customizable dashboards.

# Audi Car Search

A **reverse-engineered car search tool** that helps find the cheapest certified pre-owned Audi vehicles across America by analyzing Audi's website data and search functionality.

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced web scraping and reverse engineering techniques to create a more powerful search tool than what's available on the official Audi website. By analyzing network traffic and API endpoints, I built a comprehensive search system for finding the best deals on certified pre-owned Audi vehicles.

## Motivation

The official Audi website had limited search and filtering capabilities, making it difficult to:
- Find the absolute cheapest vehicles across all dealerships
- Compare vehicles across multiple states efficiently  
- Get comprehensive nationwide search results
- Sort and filter by specific criteria not available on the website

## Technical Achievement

### Reverse Engineering Process
- **Network Traffic Analysis** - Intercepted and analyzed API calls
- **Endpoint Discovery** - Identified internal search APIs and data sources
- **Authentication Bypass** - Worked around rate limiting and restrictions
- **Data Structure Mapping** - Understood the internal data models and schemas

### Search Capabilities
- **Nationwide Coverage** - Search across all Audi dealerships in America
- **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by price, mileage, year, model, color, features
- **Comprehensive Results** - Access to inventory not easily found on the website
- **Price Optimization** - Find the absolute cheapest options available

## Key Features

### Enhanced Search
- **Multi-state Search** - Search across state boundaries simultaneously
- **Price Sorting** - Find the cheapest vehicles first
- **Mileage Optimization** - Balance price vs. mileage for best value
- **Model Comparison** - Compare different Audi models side-by-side

### Data Analysis
- **Market Insights** - Understand pricing trends across regions
- **Inventory Tracking** - Monitor availability and price changes
- **Deal Identification** - Automatically identify exceptional deals
- **Geographic Analysis** - See pricing variations by location

### User Experience
- **Fast Results** - Quicker than manual website navigation
- **Comprehensive Views** - See more data than the official interface
- **Export Options** - Save search results and vehicle lists
- **Historical Tracking** - Monitor vehicles over time

## Technical Implementation

### Web Scraping & APIs
- **HTTP Client** - Custom requests and session management
- **Rate Limiting** - Respectful crawling without overloading servers
- **Error Handling** - Robust handling of network issues and changes
- **Data Parsing** - Extract and normalize vehicle information

### Data Processing
- **Information Extraction** - Parse vehicle details and specifications
- **Price Analysis** - Calculate market values and identify deals
- **Geolocation** - Map dealership locations and calculate distances
- **Deduplication** - Handle duplicate listings across platforms

### Architecture
- **Modular Design** - Separate concerns for scraping, processing, and presentation
- **Configuration Management** - Easy updates for website changes
- **Logging & Monitoring** - Track performance and identify issues
- **Scalable Processing** - Handle large volumes of vehicle data

## Results & Impact

### Personal Success
- **Successful Purchase** - Found and purchased the cheapest certified Audi in America
- **Significant Savings** - Saved thousands compared to local dealership prices
- **Market Knowledge** - Gained comprehensive understanding of Audi pricing
- **Geographic Insights** - Discovered regional pricing variations

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Reverse Engineering** - Successfully analyzed complex web applications
- **Data Analysis** - Processed and interpreted large vehicle datasets
- **Problem Solving** - Created solutions to real-world search limitations
- **Web Technologies** - Advanced understanding of web APIs and scraping

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- **API Stability** - Websites frequently change their internal APIs
- **Anti-scraping Measures** - Sites implement various protection mechanisms
- **Data Quality** - Real-world data requires extensive cleaning and validation
- **Performance Optimization** - Large-scale data processing requires careful optimization

### Business Understanding
- **Market Dynamics** - Automotive pricing varies significantly by geography
- **Dealer Networks** - Complex relationships between manufacturers and dealers
- **Inventory Management** - Vehicle availability changes rapidly
- **Consumer Tools** - Gap between what companies provide and what users need

## Disclaimer

This project was created for educational purposes and personal use. It demonstrates technical capabilities in web scraping and data analysis while respecting the target website's terms of service. The tool was used responsibly for legitimate car shopping purposes.

**Note:** This tool may no longer function due to changes in Audi's website and API structure. It serves as a historical example of reverse engineering techniques and automotive data analysis.

# How to Migrate

There are many ways to migrate to GitHub Actions. The best way to migrate depends on your current CI/CD system and how complex your workflows are.

## [Importer](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/using-github-actions-importer-to-automate-migrations)

The GitHub Actions Importer can be a great first step in migrating but it will not cover all use cases.

The importer includes forecasting capabilities to help you understand the cost of migrating to GitHub Actions.

## Copilot

You can leverage [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans) to help you write workflows. Copilot greatly accelerates the process of writing workflows if you can provide it context and your old workflow files.

# Understanding Platform Limits

There are numerous platforms limits in place to ensure the stability and reliability of GitHub Actions.

A majority of the limits can be adjusted by contacting GitHub support or your account manager.

* [Limits in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/actions-limits)
* [Concurrency Limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/overview/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits)

## Exception Process

If you need to increase any of the limits, you can contact GitHub support or your account manager. They will review your request and may grant an exception on a case-by-case basis.

# How to Manage Cost and Billing

GitHub Actions is a metered product so we need to be careful about how we use it to avoid unexpected costs.

## Pricing

GitHub Actions is free for public repositories. For private repositories, GitHub offers a range of pricing plans based on usage.

See [Cost](/docs/guides/github-actions/Intro%20to%20Concepts#Cost) for more information on pricing.

Budgets and alerts allow you to track spending on metered products for your accounts, organizations, cost centers (enterprise only), and repositories.

## Invoicing

GitHub Actions usage is billed monthly. You can view your invoice in the billing settings of your account or organization.

## Paying Through GitHub vs MSFT Azure

GitHub Actions can be billed through and azure subscription. This also means discounts applied to that Azure subscription will apply to GitHub Actions usage.

If you're not using an Azure subscription, you can pay for GitHub Actions usage monthly through GitHub.

# How to Use and Create Actions (Marketplace)

## What is an Action?

Actions are the building blocks that power your workflow. A workflow can contain one or more actions, either as individual steps or as part of an action group. An action is a reusable unit of code that can be used in multiple workflows. You can create your own actions, use actions created by the GitHub community, or use a combination of both.

## Types of Actions

Javascript actions are the most popular and easiest to get started with, Docker containers package the environment with the GitHub Actions code, and Composite actions are a way to reuse actions in a more modular way.

There are three types of custom actions:

# Game of Life

An interactive implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, the famous cellular automaton that demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.

## Overview

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## The Rules

Conway's Game of Life follows four simple rules:

1. **Underpopulation** - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
2. **Survival** - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
3. **Overpopulation** - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
4. **Reproduction** - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell

Despite these simple rules, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex and beautiful patterns.

## Famous Patterns

### Static Patterns (Still Lifes)

So it's 12:51 on a Wednesday afternoon and I've got nothing in the fridge. I've been using AI for everything so why isn't AI making me lunch? Let's see if we can get GitHub Copilot (or any AI agent with MCP functionality) to order us food. Seems like a simple task.

 <summary>I ask Claude "can you order me food from uber eats?"</summary>
austenstone: can you order me food from uber eats?

GitHub Copilot: I'm sorry, but I can't order food from Uber Eats for you! 😅 As an AI assistant working within VS Code, I don't have the ability to access external services like food delivery apps or make purchases on your behalf.

However, I noticed you're currently working on a blog post called `2025-08-20-im-hungry.md` - maybe that's a fun coincidence! 🍕

If you're hungry, you'll need to:
- Open the Uber Eats app or website yourself
- Browse restaurants in your Fort Lauderdale area
- Place your order directly

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your portfolio website or code instead? 🤔

austenstone: Actually I think you can... you have access to a browser

GitHub Copilot: You're absolutely right! 🤯 I do have access to a browser through the Playwright tools. Let me help you order food from Uber Eats! Perfect! I can see the Uber Eats website has loaded. Now I need to enter your delivery address first. Since you mentioned you're in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, let me click on the address input field and enter that location. Great! I can see the address input field is now active and expanded. Now I'll type "Fort Lauderdale, FL" to set your delivery location. Perfect! Now let me wait a moment for the suggestions to appear and then take a snapshot to see the available location options. Excellent! I can see several Fort Lauderdale location options have appeared. Let me select one of the Fort Lauderdale Beach options since that's a nice central location. I'll click on the Fort Lauderdale Beach option. Perfect! 🎉 I can see we're now on the Uber Eats feed page for Fort Lauderdale Beach and the page is loading content. Let me wait for the restaurants to load and then take a snapshot to see what dining options are available. Fantastic! 🍽️ Now I can see a huge selection of restaurants available in Fort Lauderdale! The page has loaded with tons of dining options. I can see there are many great choices with various cuisines and special offers. 

Here are some highlights I can see:

**Popular National Chains:**
- Shake Shack
- Chipotle Mexican Grill (with Free Item when you spend $15)
- Popeyes (Save on Select Items)
- Wingstop (2 Offers Available)
- Chick-fil-A

- And many more!

**Local/Regional Options:**

- And tons more!

**Special Deals I can see:**

What type of food are you in the mood for? I can help you select a restaurant and walk through the ordering process! 🤔 Are you feeling like:

- Pizza 🍕
- Asian food 🍜
- Mexican 🌮  
- Burgers 🍔
- Something healthy 🥗

Wow... okay! I eat out more than I should and even I'm impressed by these options! As tempting as is it is to order food now I'm determined to have copilot do it for me.

Let's make up our mind. The Naked Farmer bowl with spicy harissa sauce is calling my name!

After struggling with copilot a bit I had it add the item and funny enough it started deciding the ingredients for me. Too bad it has no idea what my taste is and no historical context of what I've ordered in the past.

Okay this technically worked but I could do it faster myself without all the back and forth. We need to find a better long term solution and I think MCP is going to help us.

I have some ideas on how we can improve:
1. We need the agent to know about my preferences, where I live, etc.
2. I want the agent to find ideas for me including new restaurants in the area.
3. I'd like a predefined prompt to more efficiently order the things I want.
4. We need to find or create an Uber Eats MCP server for this that is pre-authenticated.


Let's create a new repository to house our [copilot customizations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization).

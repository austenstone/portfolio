import PhotoSwipeGallery from '@site/src/components/PhotoSwipeGallery';
import photoUrls from './photo-urls.json';

I wanted to display some photography on my website but I wasn't interested in hosting the photos. That's what I pay google every month for. So I built an easy to run tool that scrapes your google photos albums for public links. I'll use this tool to get links for albums I create.

I'm kind of into photography. About a year ago I bought this fancy [S5II Full Frame Mirrorless Camera](https://shop.panasonic.com/products/s5m2-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-body). It was mostly to use as a webcam for zoom meetings but I always thought photography and film were really cool. I took a photography class growing up and I took a lot of pictures back when I worked at the PR firm so I had a general sense of how to shoot. I'm still an amuture but It's fun for me.

You've probably seen a theme of me using GitHub Copilot so of course I vibe coded most of this project. I pointed to blog posts I found, asked it to come up with a plan. It wrote the plan to a file. Then I wrote all the code with Claude Sonnet 4.

Claude was caught up on the lazy loading images and scrolling through them properly. It did figure it out but not well enough to exhaustively get a full list of images. I was able to figure out the proper scrolling technique and we continued on with the headless automation solution.

Check out the code on GitHub:

Or run the tool yourself:

```bash
npx google-photos-scraper https://photos.app.goo.gl/kXEc4X8Lfrh7qEKdA
```

It works great and was fairly easy to setup. Here are some pictures from my recent trip to Spain as an example:

description: A comprehensive GitHub Actions cheat sheet inspired by Learn X in Y Minutes - everything you need to know in one commented YAML file.
---

I've created a comprehensive [GitHub Actions cheat sheet](/docs/guides/github-actions/Cheat%20Sheet) inspired by the [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) format.

## GitHub Actions in Y Minutes

Following the same philosophy, I've distilled everything you need to know about GitHub Actions into a single, comprehensive YAML workflow file.

Every line is annotated so you can skim for syntax or dive deeper into specific features.

## Check It Out

View the complete [GitHub Actions Cheat Sheet](/docs/guides/github-actions/Cheat%20Sheet) in the documentation section.

The format makes complex CI/CD concepts approachableâ€”you'll understand workflows, jobs, and automation patterns in minutes rather than hours.

*Inspired by the [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) project's philosophy of learning through annotated examples.*

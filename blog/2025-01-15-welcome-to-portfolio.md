Welcome to my new portfolio website! After years of using my old Angular-based site, I've migrated everything to Docusaurus to create a better experience for showcasing my projects and sharing my thoughts.

<!--truncate-->

## Why the Migration?

My old Angular site served me well, but I wanted something that would be:
- **Easier to maintain** - Markdown-based content is much simpler to update
- **Better for SEO** - Server-side generation and proper meta tags
- **More accessible** - Built-in accessibility features and semantic HTML
- **Documentation-friendly** - Perfect for detailed project explanations

## What You'll Find Here

### Projects
I've documented all my major projects with detailed explanations, screenshots, and links to live demos.

### Blog
I'll be sharing thoughts on software engineering, GitHub Actions, developer tools, and my experiences working with enterprise customers at GitHub.

### Resume
My professional experience and skills are now presented in a clean, easy-to-read format.

## Technical Stack

This new site is built with:
- **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** - The static site generator that powers this site
- **TypeScript & React** - For type safety and component-based development  
- **GitHub Pages** - For reliable hosting and deployment
- **Modern CSS** - Responsive design with custom styling

## What's Next?

I'll be regularly updating this site with:
- New project documentation as I build things
- Blog posts about interesting technical challenges
- Updates to existing projects and their impact
- Insights from my work at GitHub

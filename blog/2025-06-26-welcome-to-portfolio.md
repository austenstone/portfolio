I've migrated my portfolio from Angular to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) to focus more on content and less on maintenance.

## Why Docusaurus?

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is built specifically for content creators who want to focus on writing rather than wrestling with complex build systems. Here's what makes it perfect for my needs:

**Content-First Approach**: Writing in Markdown is a game-changer. Instead of wrestling with Angular components for every blog post, I can now focus purely on content. This means more frequent updates, better documentation for my projects, and less time spent on the technical overhead of publishing.

**Built for Performance**: Docusaurus follows the PRPL Pattern for lightning-fast loading, generates static HTML for SEO, and provides client-side routing for a smooth single-page app experience.

**Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, MDX support for interactive components, and sensible defaults mean I can ship content quickly without sacrificing functionality.

GitHub Copilot's agentic mode was incredibly helpful during the migration - it handled a lot of the repetitive work and helped me understand Docusaurus patterns quickly.

## What's Here

- **Projects**: Detailed documentation of my GitHub Actions, DeviceWISE View, and other work
- **Blog**: Technical insights and experiences from my role at GitHub
- **Resume**: Professional experience and skills
